An incomplete idea or some scenes might be floating in your mind. Or it may be possible that you have the full video idea.

Start by taking out ur notebook , pulling out your pen and write distinctly all the scenes part by part. also write the bgm music , sound effects , vfx , animations required

THERE MIGHT BE 2 MOODS OF U. DEPENDING ON WHICH WILL WORK OUT THE WORKFLOW FROM THE GIVEN TWO :-  1. OPEN THE VIDEO EDITING APP AND ADD MUSIC FIRST
                                                                                                  2. OPEN THE VIDEO EDITING APP AND ADD REFERENCES FIRST.


Let's get to the actual work now:

      STEP 1 ->  gather all the references - clips , images , audio files 
      
      STEP 2 ->  create the zeroth draft video using references and export it from the video editing software

      STEP 3 ->  pick the easiest scene or the one you want to start from. Analyze the requirements - location, characters , animations, and put them together one by one in the sequence you want.
                 create the level sequence and build the scene

      STEP 4 ->  Do step 3 for all the scenes. you might end up getting different results than the references, maybe better. put them all in the editing software and export the first draft.

      STEP 5 ->  Publish the first draft and wait for response , reviews from others and from you as well.

      STEP 6 ->  Put together list of all the improvements and work for them when you get the moment.
